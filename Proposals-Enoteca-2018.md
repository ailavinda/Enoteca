##  - Name of the app: "Enoteca" = an Italian word of Greecian origin signifying 
      "repository of wines".

##  - [User stories] (how the app will be used): Wine collectors might be interested in 
  saving information from the package label. Kept in a database, the information 
  presents a basis for structured knowlage about wines: grapes, styles, regions of 
  origin, and producers. An API from major Canadian supplier of wines (LCBO) could be
  used to automate the collection of lable data.

##  - Wireframes:

- Please consult [Enoteca app wireframes](./helpers/wireframes.md).

- Link to the [LCBO API](https://lcboapi.com).

- A link to the NPM package in use (https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment).

- Foreseen challenges or obstacles: time-wise uncertanty in estimation of debugging efforts.
