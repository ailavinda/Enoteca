('Sauvingnon Blanc', 'New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc assails the senses with red capsicum (bell pepper) and gooseberry characters, lush tropical fruit overtones, fresh cut grass, tomato stalks, and grapefruit or lime.
', 'The ''zing'' of Sauvignon Blanc is a delightful complement to the fresh flavours of seafood, shellfish and white fish, and enhances citrus or garlic based sauces. On its own, Sauvignon Blanc is a mouth-watering aperitif, especially on a bright summer''s day. ', 'When Marlborough''s first Sauvignon Blanc vines were planted, no one could have predicted the superstar status that this variety would attain within a couple of decades. Sauvignon Blanc was commercially produced on our shores for the first time in 1979, and is now New Zealandâ€™s most widely planted variety.', '

('Chardonnay', 'A wide-range of Chardonnay styles are produced in New Zealand, from fruit-driven and unoaked, to luscious examples with complexity, elegance, and a touch of oak.', 'A young or unoaked Chardonnay is fabulous with seafood. Mature New Zealand Chardonnays are richer and more complex with stronger toast and nut flavour. Our Chardonnay complements full flavoured savoury dishes such as chicken, veal and rabbit with creamy, garlic or lemon flavoured sauces. The creamy, fruit-driven flavours of mature New Zealand Chardonnay are sublime alongside a dessert of poached pears.', 'New Zealand Chardonnay strongly reflects our unique terroir, and the huge diversity within the different regions. During the 1990s, plantings of this internationally fashionable variety exceeded those of every other grape, today top quality Chardonnay can be found in every region.', 'https://www.nzwine.com/media/1692/s059-161-chardonnay-synposium.DaovcA.jpg', 'https://www.nzwine.com/en/our-winestyles/chardonnay/'),
('Pinot Gris', 'Grown throughout New Zealand, our Pinot Gris is fresh and full-flavoured, with notes of apple, pear, honeysuckle, spice and bread.', 'The gentle acidity and marked fruitiness of a well balanced Pinot Gris perfectly complements roast pork with a stewed pear sauce, or match with creamy pastas, poultry and seafood.', 'Barrel ageing, fermenting with native, wild yeasts, and lees stirring are common winemaking practices in New Zealand to build texture, mouth feel and complexity. Breaking on to the New Zealand scene in the early 1990s, Pinot Gris has enjoyed a dramatic rise to fame and is now our third most popular white variety.', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Pinot_Gris_close.JPG', '
